# Synopsis
* This is a ReactJS based web app with D3.js, which serves as a landing page for a webapp. 
* Time taken to build this app is: 6 hrs. 

# Tech Stack
* ReactJS
* D3.js for chart 
* vanilla CSS for styling

# Whats lacking
* Missing the tooltip on hover (didn't find a working solution)
* Missing the price value over each bar as mentioned in the design (throws an err, solution to which wasn't found)

# Improvements I wanted to make if given time 
* Could use a UI component library (eg. MUI) to speed up the development.
* Use CSS preprocessors to format CSS files better rather than using confusing vanilla CSS.
* Would take time to learn D3 better and implement Tooltip and price values over each bar.
